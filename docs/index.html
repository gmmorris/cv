Alongside my tech pursuits, I've made a name for myself as a successful photographer, showcasing my work in Israel and London, handling commercial projects for clients in the Israeli entertainment sector, and participating in prominent art fairs. Additionally, I'm an avid martial artist, currently holding a 2nd Master grade in Wing Tsun Kung Fu, and a dedicated rock climber. Beyond these interests, I'm an avid commentator on political and theological matters, and in 2014, I was honored as one of Quora's Top Writers - they gifted me a custom fleece jacket, which I'm too embarassed to actually wear. My life revolves around creation, which might explain why I've found a welcoming home in both the startup and art scenes. </p> </section> </div> <div class="col-9"> <section id="profile"> <h3>Profile</h3> <p> I'm an accomplished technology leader with a track record of building, leading and nurturing top-performing engineering teams, and delivering products with sustainable efficiency. With over two decades of experience, I've held various technical and managerial roles at different levels. My focus extends beyond technical expertise to include agile practices, <a target="_blank" href="https://gidi.io/team-dynamics/2022/02/20/remote-isnt-distributed/">team dynamics</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://gidi.io/team-dynamics/2018/07/28/the-secret-sauce-to-an-effective-team/">continuous improvement</a>, and mentorship, all vital for successful product delivery.

This involved expanding the Elastic Alerting project from a small engineering team to a robust 20+ person organisation. I led the recruitment and onboarding of engineers into multiple teams and provided guidance to area leads as they adapted to a new agile process in <a target="_blank" href="https://gidi.io/team-dynamics/2022/02/20/remote-isnt-distributed/">a distributed work environment</a>.<br> I introduced a cross-departmental structure to enhance collaboration and prioritisation, facilitating alignment between the Platform, Security, and Observability product teams by enabling them to understand each other's priorities, constraints, and incentives. Additionally, I conducted a series of organization-wide learning and development training sessions focusing on Catalytic Skills, which encompassed essential communication skills and a growth mindset required for high-performing teams to collaborate and function effectively.<br> Led the hiring process to identify a suitable replacement for my role as I departed the company to focus on climate change. </p> </div> </li> <li id="elasticPosition"> <div> <h4>Elastic</h4> <em>Principal Software Engineer</em> <ol> <li>2019</li> <li>2020</li> </ol> <p> Significantly improved the scalability of the Elastic Alerting framework powering our Security and Observability products, growing rule capacity 100x per-node throughout Kibana's distributed Task Manager. </p> </div> </li> <li id="unrlyPosition"> <div> <h4>Unruly</h4> <em>Senior Software Developer (Supply-Side Team Lead)</em> <ol> <li>2016</li> <li>2019</li> </ol> <p> <strong>Engineering management</strong> of an Extreme Programming (XP) development team of over 10 members, providing <a target="_blank" href="https://gidi.io/team-dynamics/2018/07/28/the-secret-sauce-to-an-effective-team/">mentorship</a> and practical technical guidance.
