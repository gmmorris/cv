            <p class="small-12 medium-8 columns">
                I am an experienced generalist software developer who has worn many different hats throughout their
                career.
                <br /> My primary focus throughout most of my career has been the Javascript ecosystem as a whole, but I
                have also acquired a
                solid background in other stacks, ranging across the spectrum from Front End, through to Back End and
                deeper still into Infrastructure.
                <br /> I have been lucky enough to gain experience working on a wide variety of projects ranging from
                jobs for
                large enterprise companies to smaller high-scale high-growth companies as well as fast paced early stage
                start-ups.
                <br /> I have experience at hands-on technical leadership of product development, as well as the
                mentorship and
                training of other engineers, and find both of these an equally important aspect of my profession.
                <br /> I am highly passionate about my work, strong in my professional opinions, and am highly driven to
                not only
                produce high-quality sustainable work, but to also positively impact my community in all aspects ranging
                from technical
                expertise to diversity and inclusivity.

                        other
                        developers along with that endevour. I enjoyed working with Gidi as he always brought positive
                        energy
                        and willingness to dive into research of new product features. On top of his technical skills,
                        he
                        built great relationships with senior stakeholders across Unruly and supported integrations with
                        external partners. I was able to rely on him to cover all aspects of team lead role when I
                        needed
                        to be elsewhere. However, I was happy to see him switch teams to take the lead on a mission to
                        improve
                        areas of the Javascript codebase that had been suffering from neglect and required an
                        incremental
                        approach to bring the code closer to modern standards.

                        I've been working with Gidi for just over a year, and he's the very model of a senior developer.
                        He gets things done, and
                        builds the right relationships with the business to ensure he's getting the right things done.
                        He's
                        an excellent teacher - not just filling the surface gaps in knowledge, but identifying the
                        fundamental
                        misconceptions and fixing those first. And he's focused on making sure the team does the right
                        thing
                        for the future - being it building a more robust process, using composable, functional
                        programming
                        approaches, or promoting diversity.

                        I had the pleasure of working with Gidi for two years at loveholidays.com. We hired Gidi at a
                        time when our “version zero”
                        front-end codebase was in greatest need of a strong professional to take us through our first
                        major
                        re-architecture. Gidi is just such a pro. Under his guidance we achieved everything we set out
                        to
                        do during his time with us and more.
                        <br /> Gidi is one of those “super senior” developers who really understands his medium. Having
                        someone
                        with his knowledge, insight, passion and pragmatism on your team is a sure way to advance the
                        cause
                        of your software project. No matter what the challenges are, you can be sure he will bring all
                        of
                        his skills and experience to bear on the problem.
                        <br /> I would highly recommend him to any team.

                        I worked with Gidi back in 2010 at Metacafe, and we had so much fun working together I knew
                        we’ll have to do it again. When
                        we became busy with client work at Really Good recently, we turned to Gidi, who was happy to
                        assist
                        with four different projects, and then delivered like a pro. Gidi is a top-notch end to end
                        developer,
                        a creative professional who not only knows his stuff, but is both independent and responsible.
                        He
                        can identify issues, come up with the best ways to solve them and then make it look easy. If you
                        ever have the chance of working with him, as a developer or anything else, you’re in luck. Don’t
                        miss it.
