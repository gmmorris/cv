						<h3>
							Who Am I Really?
						</h3>
						<p>
							I grew up in an agricultural village in Israel, but it was in Tel Aviv that I truly discovered my passions and interests.<br>
In addition to my tech pursuits, I've enjoyed exploring various hobbies. Photography has been a fulfilling endeavor, with opportunities to exhibit my work in Israel and London and collaborate on commercial projects in the entertainment sector. I'm also enthusiastic about martial arts and have achieved a 2nd Master grade in Wing Tsun Kung Fu, as well as a dedicated rock climber.<br>
I'm also an avid commentator on political and theological matters, possibly too much, as in 2014 Quora named me one of their Top Writers - an achievement that came with a custom fleece jacket, which I cherish but seldom wear.
