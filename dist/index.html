									<h4>Elastic</h4>
									<em>Senior Engineering Manager (Alerting &amp; ResponseOps Team Lead)</em>
									<p>
										Took leadership of Elastic's alerting initiative at a critical inflection point - evolving it from a beta feature into an enterprise-grade product that would power our Security and Observability offerings.
										Scaled our <a target="_blank" href="https://gidi.io/team-dynamics/2022/02/20/remote-isnt-distributed/">distributed product engineering team</a> from 3 to 20+ engineers across multiple time zones, building out the recruiting process, onboarding process, and leadership structure of the team.
										Spearheaded a cross-departmental collaboration framework that aligned three major product areas (Platform, Security, Observability) around shared priorities, tradeoffs and technical constraints - breaking down silos that had historically slowed delivery.
										Formulated and delivered company-wide Catalytic Skills training sessions to dozens of engineers, fostering the communication and growth mindset skills essential for effective collaboration.
									</p>
									<p>
									<em style="font-weight: bold">Impact</em>: Laid the groundwork for alerting to become a core revenue-generating differentiator across Elastic's entire product line.

						<h3>
							Who Am I Really?
						</h3>
						<p>
							I grew up in an agricultural village in Israel, but it was in Tel Aviv that I truly discovered my passions and interests.<br>
In addition to my tech pursuits, I've enjoyed exploring various hobbies. Photography has been a fulfilling endeavor, with opportunities to exhibit my work in Israel and London and collaborate on commercial projects in the entertainment sector. I'm also enthusiastic about martial arts and have achieved a 2nd Master grade in Wing Tsun Kung Fu, as well as a dedicated rock climber.<br>
I'm also an avid commentator on political and theological matters, possibly too much, as in 2014 Quora named me one of their Top Writers - an achievement that came with a custom fleece jacket, which I cherish but seldom wear.
